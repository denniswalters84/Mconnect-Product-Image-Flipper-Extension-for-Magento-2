<p>One study found that 83% of the consumers responded saying that product images are the most influential when it comes to making a purchase decision. The difference between shopping online and on the physical store is that the later provides you the facility to see, feel, and look at the product which the former does not. So, all customers have to rely on the images of those products. All their purchase decisions are based on the available description of the product and pictures from different angles. But some might not reach on the product detail pages because they might leave store after seeing the product on listing pages. Therefore, you need a functionality that allows your customers to see different angle pictures or videos from product listing pages itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mconnectmedia.com/product-flipper-m2.html"><strong>Mconnect</strong> <strong>Product Image Flipper Extension for Magento 2</strong></a> provides Magento store owners a facility to showcase the different images and videos of the product by hovering over them. The extension will change the main image of the product from the product listing pages with the secondary image or video. A flip effect takes place whenever a customer searches for products and hover over any of the product while still being on the listing page without going into a particular product page. The admin can simply upload flipper images from the backend catalog page. Also, the extension allows you to upload video or a link to an existing YouTube video. And the best thing about this is that it works with any theme and does not affect the page load time.</p>
